//The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.
//The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator

//* Airthmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers
//* +	Addition
//* -	Subtraction
// *	Multiplication
// **	Exponentiation (ES2016) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.
//* /	Division
//* %	Modulus (Division Remainder)
//* ++	Increment
//* --	Decrement

// the two numbers can be literals(d); or variables(c); or expression(line-32)
